# C# Simple Calculator

* This is a simple calculator made in C# with learning purposes, which means that is not supposed to be performatic or safe, only a practice project.
* How to run?
  * Clone the project from this GitHub repository, make sure you have VisualStudio installed or any other IDE that runs C#.
  * Open the project in the VisualStudio environment, and run it :)
  * It's supposed to be a calculator on the console, so do not expect any Windows Form.
